# Description
Netflix account pin cracker

If there is a Netflix account pin that you do not know,
you can crack it in 1 hour with this tool.

It starts from 0000 and tries up to 9999 (you can also set the start and end yourself.)

When the correct code is entered, the software cannot detect it, so when trying the codes,
keep track of what numbers they are trying.

# Pre-requirements
You will need to have Python installed as well as the keyboard package.

# Use

- Run the miner.py file.
- Select the start of the 4-digit number (optional, press ENTER to use the default 0000).
- Select the end of the 4-digit number (optional, press ENTER to use the default 9999).
- Set the time between each keystroke (optional, press ENTER to use the default 0.02).
- Set the time between each code (optional, press ENTER to use the default 0.05).
- Now select the netflix account you want to hack the pin and press the SHIFT button while the pin writing part is selected.
- Enjoy! The only thing left is to follow the entered code and wait for it to find the correct code.
